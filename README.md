# Red Wine Quality - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Red Wine Quality dataset to understand how different physicochemical properties affect wine quality.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Type: Red Wine Quality Dataset
- Rows: 1599
- Columns: 12

## Features
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (target variable)

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## EDA Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Checking missing values
- Statistical summary
- Univariate analysis
- Bivariate analysis
- Correlation heatmap
- Insights extraction

## Key Insights
- Alcohol shows strong positive correlation with wine quality
- Volatile acidity negatively impacts quality
- Most wines are rated between 5 and 6

## Conclusion
EDA helped in understanding the structure and key influencing factors of wine quality, which can be useful for building predictive models in future.
